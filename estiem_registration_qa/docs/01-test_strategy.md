# Test Strategy – ESTIEM Registration & Event Management Platform

## 1. Introduction
The purpose of this Test Strategy is to define the overall testing approach for the ESTIEM Registration & Event Management Platform.  
The system enables international users to register for events, manage their data, and interact with organizational workflows.  
Testing ensures reliability, usability, and stability across different countries, browsers, and usage scenarios.  

---

## 2. Objectives
- Verify correctness and stability of registration workflows (sign-up, login, form submissions).  
- Ensure seamless integration between front-end (forms/UI) and back-end services (databases, APIs).  
- Validate performance under load (simultaneous event registrations).  
- Guarantee data integrity through SQL queries and validation checks.  
- Enhance user experience by identifying and resolving UI/UX bottlenecks.  

---

## 3. Scope
### In Scope
- Functional testing of registration forms, dashboards, and user flows.  
- API testing of registration endpoints (validation, error handling, payloads).  
- Cross-browser and cross-device testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Mobile).  
- SQL validation for data consistency.  
- Regression testing before each major event launch.  
- Performance and load testing of the registration module.  

### Out of Scope
- Internal finance and invoicing modules (tested by separate team).  
- Deep security penetration testing (covered by IT Security group).  

---

## 4. Assumptions & Risks
### Assumptions
- Requirements are clearly documented in Notion and Trello.  
- Test environment mirrors production as closely as possible.  
- Agile methodology is applied with sprints of 2 weeks.  

### Risks
- Limited test environment availability before peak event launches.  
- Last-minute requirement changes impacting test coverage.  
- High load during registration deadlines could reveal untested bottlenecks.

## 5. Test Approach
- **Functional Testing**: Positive/negative scenarios, edge cases, boundary values.  
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end flows across modules (registration → confirmation email → database).  
- **UI/UX Testing**: Usability checks (clarity of forms, accessibility, error messages).  
- **API Testing**: Using Postman for validation, error handling, status codes, JSON payloads.  
- **Database Validation**: SQL queries for data accuracy and consistency.  
- **Performance Testing**: Simulate 500+ concurrent registrations using JMeter.  

---

## 6. Test Automation
- Partial automation planned for regression scenarios (critical workflows: registration, login, email confirmation).  
- Automation stack: Python + Pytest + Requests (for API), Selenium/Playwright (for UI).  
- CI/CD integration via GitHub Actions.  

---

## 7. Test Environment
- **Staging environment**: mirrors production (database replicas, event data).  
- **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge.  
- **Devices**: Desktop (Windows/Linux/Mac), Mobile (Android/iOS).  
- **Tools**: Postman, JMeter, SQL Workbench, Trello, Jira/Notion.

## 8. Milestones & Deliverables
### Test Schedule
- Sprint-based QA activities with defined test cycles.  
- Smoke testing after each deployment.  
- Full regression before every event launch.  

### Deliverables
- Test Plan  
- Test Scenarios & Test Cases  
- Bug Reports in Jira  
- SQL validation reports  
- Test Summary Report after each release  

---

## 9. Exit Criteria
- All critical and high-priority defects resolved.  
- Regression test suite passed.  
- Performance tests within acceptable thresholds.  
- Stakeholder sign-off on test results.
