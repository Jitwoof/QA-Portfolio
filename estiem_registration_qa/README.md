## Introduction

In 2023, as part of my work at **ESTIEM** (European Students of Industrial Engineering and Management), I led a mini QA initiative to enhance the quality and usability of registration forms and event landing pages for international student events. I treated it with a product mindset â€” focusing on **quality assurance**, **user experience**, and **data accuracy**.

##  Problem

There were some issues:

* Broken fields in registration forms
* Missing validations (users submitted empty forms)
* Confusing UI / unclear steps
* Low form completion rate
* Inconsistent data for internal use

Our goal was to ensure that event registration forms and landing pages work flawlessly across devices and deliver clean, complete data to event organizers.

## My QA Workflow

### 1. Requirements Analysis

* Defined business requirements with stakeholders (form purpose, target users, expected data)
* Identified mandatory vs optional fields, expected field formats

### 2. Test Design

* Created a **test checklist** (cross-browser, mobile/desktop, negative/positive inputs)
* Designed **test cases** with clear test data, expected results, edge cases

### 3. Test Execution

* Tested forms on **mobile** and **desktop** across Chrome, Safari, Firefox
* Used boundary values and invalid formats to check validation
* Tested usability and flow with real users (UX review with 5 international students)

### 4. Bug Reporting

* Logged bugs with severity, reproducibility, screenshots and clear steps
* Example bugs:

  * Form accepted empty email field (Major)
  * Dropdown didnâ€™t render on Safari (Minor)
  * Broken redirect after submission (Critical)

### 5. Improvements & Iteration

* Collaborated with content and dev teams to fix UX issues
* Re-tested every version (regression testing)
* Integrated Google Forms with Notion and Trello for better internal data workflow
