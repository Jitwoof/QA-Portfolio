# QA Portfolio — Yuliana Yaroshevich

Welcome! This is my personal QA engineering portfolio. Here I have a structured collection of projects, test documentation, and hands-on examples of manual and API testing.

---

## About Me

I’m a QA Engineer with practical experience in testing web applications, REST APIs, and client-server interactions. I design clean test cases, write detailed bug reports, and enjoy solving tricky bugs through both manual investigation and API diagnostics.  

I value clear documentation, structured thinking, and constant learning. My background includes working with international project teams (ESTIEM), developing a Telegram bot from scratch, and creating full-cycle QA documentation.
